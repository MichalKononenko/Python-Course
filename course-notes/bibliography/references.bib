	abstract = {The authors present the complete guide to {ANSI} standard C language programming. Written by the developers of C, this new version helps readers keep up with the finalized {ANSI} standard for C while showing how to take advantage of C's rich set of operators, economy of expression, improved control flow, and data structures. The 2/E has been completely rewritten with additional examples and problem sets to clarify the implementation of difficult language constructs. For years, C programmers have let K\&R guide them to building well-structured and efficient programs. Now this same help is available to those working with {ANSI} compilers. Includes detailed coverage of the C language plus the official C language reference manual for at-a-glance help with syntax notation, declarations, {ANSI} changes, scope rules, and the list goes on and on.},

	abstract = {Hilbert's program was an ambitious and wide-ranging project in the philosophy and foundations of mathematics. In order to "dispose of the foundational questions in mathematics once and for all, "Hilbert proposed a two-pronged approach in 1921: first, classical mathematics should be formalized in axiomatic systems; second, using only restricted, "finitary" means, one should give proofs of the consistency of these axiomatic systems. Although Godel's incompleteness theorems show that the program as originally conceived cannot be carried out, it had many partial successes, and generated important advances in logical theory and meta-theory, both at the time and since. The article discusses the historical background and development of Hilbert's program, its philosophical underpinnings and consequences, and its subsequent development and influences since the 1930s.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02013},
	shorttitle = {The Thirteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey},
	abstract = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}-{IV}) began observations in July 2014. It pursues three core programs: {APOGEE}-2, {MaNGA}, and {eBOSS}. In addition, {eBOSS} contains two major subprograms: {TDSS} and {SPIDERS}. This paper describes the first data release from {SDSS}-{IV}, Data Release 13 ({DR}13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like all {SDSS} data releases, is inclusive of previously released data. {DR}13 makes publicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from {MaNGA}, the first data released from this survey. It includes new observations from {eBOSS}, completing {SEQUELS}. In addition to targeting galaxies and quasars, {SEQUELS} also targeted variability-selected objects from {TDSS} and X-ray selected objects from {SPIDERS}. {DR}13 includes new reductions of the {SDSS}-{III} {BOSS} data, improving the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift classification. {DR}13 releases new reductions of the {APOGEE}-1 data from {SDSS}-{III}, with abundances of elements not previously included and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For the {SDSS} imaging data, {DR}13 provides new, more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released in tandem with {DR}13, in particular target catalogs relevant for {eBOSS}, {TDSS}, and {SPIDERS}, and an updated red-clump catalog for {APOGEE}. This paper describes the location and format of the data now publicly available, as well as providing references to the important technical papers that describe the targeting, observing, and data reduction. The {SDSS} website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data, tutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the reduction and analysis procedures. {DR}13 is the first of a scheduled set that will contain new data and analyses from the planned {\textasciitilde}6-year operations of {SDSS}-{IV}.},
