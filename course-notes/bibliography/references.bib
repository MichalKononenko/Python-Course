	abstract = {The authors present the complete guide to {ANSI} standard C language programming. Written by the developers of C, this new version helps readers keep up with the finalized {ANSI} standard for C while showing how to take advantage of C's rich set of operators, economy of expression, improved control flow, and data structures. The 2/E has been completely rewritten with additional examples and problem sets to clarify the implementation of difficult language constructs. For years, C programmers have let K\&R guide them to building well-structured and efficient programs. Now this same help is available to those working with {ANSI} compilers. Includes detailed coverage of the C language plus the official C language reference manual for at-a-glance help with syntax notation, declarations, {ANSI} changes, scope rules, and the list goes on and on.},
